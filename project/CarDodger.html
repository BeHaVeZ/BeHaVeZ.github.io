            <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
              Alexander Terentyev built the Car Dodger app as
              a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by
              Alexander Terentyev at no cost and is intended for use as
              is.
            </p> <p>
              This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
              policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
              Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
            </p> <p>
              If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
              the collection and use of information in relation to this
              policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
              used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
              anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p> <p>
              The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
              as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
              Car Dodger unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
            </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
              For a better experience, while using our Service, I
              may require you to provide us with certain personally
              identifiable information. The information that
              I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
            </p> <div><p>
                The app does use third-party services that may collect
                information used to identify you.

              I want to inform you that whenever you
              use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
              I collect data and information (through third-party
              products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
              include information such as your device Internet Protocol
              (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
              configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
              the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
              statistics.
            </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
              Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
              commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
              to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
              stored on your device's internal memory.
            </p> <p>
              This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
              the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
              “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
              You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
              and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
              choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
              portions of this Service.
            </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
              I may employ third-party companies and
              individuals due to the following reasons:
            </p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
              I want to inform users of this Service
              that these third parties have access to their Personal
              Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
              them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
              disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
            </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
              I value your trust in providing us your
              Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
              acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
              of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
              storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
              guarantee its absolute security.
            </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
              This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
              a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
              that these external sites are not operated by me.
              Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
              Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
              no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
              privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
              services.
            </p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <div><p>
                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                I do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                me with personal information, I immediately
                delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                personal information, please contact me so that
                I will be able to do the necessary actions.
              </p></div> <!----> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
              I may update our Privacy Policy from
              time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
              periodically for any changes. I will
              notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on

          <div style="height:25rem;width:auto;border:1px solid #ccc;font:16px/26px Georgia, Garamond, Serif;overflow:auto;">    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
            By downloading or using the app, these terms will
            automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
            that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
            allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
            our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
            extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
            to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
            versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
            database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
            to it, still belong to Alexander Terentyev.
          </p> <p>
            Alexander Terentyev is committed to ensuring that the app is
            as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
            reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
            its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
            charge you for the app or its services without making it very
            clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
          </p> <p>
            The Car Dodger app stores and processes personal data that
            you have provided to us, to provide my
            Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
            access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
            not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
            removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
            official operating system of your device. It could make your
            phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
            compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
            that the Car Dodger app won’t work properly or at all.
          </p> <div><p>
              The app does use third-party services that declare their
              Terms and Conditions.

            You should be aware that there are certain things that
            Alexander Terentyev will not take responsibility for. Certain
            functions of the app will require the app to have an active
            internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
            by your mobile network provider, but Alexander Terentyev
            cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
            functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
            have any of your data allowance left.
          </p> <p></p> <p>
            If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
            should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
            mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
            be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
            the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
            other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
            responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
            charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
            (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
            you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
            using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
            received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
          </p> <p>
            Along the same lines, Alexander Terentyev cannot always take
            responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
            make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
            battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
            Alexander Terentyev cannot accept responsibility.
          </p> <p>
            With respect to Alexander Terentyev’s responsibility for your
            use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
            bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
            updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
            to provide information to us so that we can make it available
            to you. Alexander Terentyev accepts no liability for any
            loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
            relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
          </p> <p>
            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
            currently available on iOS – the requirements for the 
            system(and for any additional systems we
            decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
            and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
            using the app. Alexander Terentyev does not promise that it
            will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
            and/or works with the iOS version that you have
            installed on your device. However, you promise to always
            accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
            also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
            it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
            Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
            rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
            (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
            from your device.
          </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
            I may update our Terms and Conditions
            from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
            periodically for any changes. I will
            notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
            Conditions on this page.
